To get started first you need an account on youmint so register an account there.
Then simply place the Sms.java in the path of your file.
Simply use the function Sms.send() with your registered username password the person to whom you want to send the message and the actual  message.
I have included a sample file A.java to get you started.
Compile these files using JDK
